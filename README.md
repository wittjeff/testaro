# testaro

Ensemble testing for web accessibility

## Breaking change notices

Version 75.0.0 introduced a breaking change in the methods for making screenshots of web pages.

Version 68.0.0 introduced a breaking change in the format of reports.

## Purposes

Testaro is an application that performs ensemble testing of web pages for accessibility, usability, and conformity to HTML and CSS specifications.

The purposes of Testaro are to:

- provide programmatic access to tests defined by multiple rule engines
- standardize and integrate the reports of the rule engines

The need for ensemble testing of web accessibility, and the obstacles to it, are discussed in [Accessibility Metatesting: Comparing Nine Testing Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07591).

Testaro is described in two papers:

- [How to run a thousand accessibility tests](https://medium.com/cvs-health-tech-blog/how-to-run-a-thousand-accessibility-tests-63692ad120c3)
- [Testaro: Efficient Ensemble Testing for Web Accessibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10167)

## Functionality

Testaro performs tasks defined by a _job_. Typically, a job identifies the URL of a web page and asks Testaro to call an ensemble of rule engines to test the page. Testaro adds the results of the testing to the job, thereby converting the job to a _report_.

Testaro can be given a job to perform, in which case it performs the job, delivers the report, and quits.

Alternatively, testaro can run as a daemon, polling a server or a directory for new jobs and performing them when they are provided or when they appear in the directory.

A practical application that leverages Testaro will use other software to prepare jobs, schedule them, post-process the reports as needed, and manage the report files. Some utilities for such purposes can be found in the [Testilo project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testilo). One application that leverages Testaro for a web service is [Kilotest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jrpool/kilotest).

## Dependencies

Testaro uses:

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to launch browsers, perform user actions in them, and perform tests
- [playwright-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-extra) and [puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth) to make a Playwright-controlled browser more indistinguishable from a human-operated browser and thus make its requests more likely to succeed
- [playwright-dompath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-dompath) to retrieve XPaths of elements
- [pixelmatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixelmatch) to measure motion
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load environment variables

Testaro can perform tests of these _rule engines_:

- [Accessibility Checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) (IBM)
- [Alfa](https://alfa.siteimprove.com/) (Siteimprove)
- [ASLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@essentialaccessibility/aslint) (eSSENTIAL Accessibility)
- [Axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-playwright) (Deque)
- [Editoria11y](https://github.com/itmaybejj/editoria11y) (Princeton University)
- [HTML CodeSniffer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html_codesniffer) (Squiz Labs)
- [Nu Html Checker](https://github.com/validator/validator) (World Wide Web Consortium)
- [QualWeb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qualweb/core) (University of Lisbon)
- [Testaro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testaro) (CVS Health)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/api/) (WebAIM)

For the rule engines that are open-source, the identified organizations are their principal or original sponsors.

As shown, Testaro is not only an integrator but also one of the integrated rule engines. That is because it provides about 50 tests of its own, mostly to complement tests provided by the other rule engines. Some of those Testaro tests are designed to act as approximate alternatives to tests of vulnerable, restricted, or no longer available rule engines. In all such cases the Testaro tests are independently designed and implemented, without reference to the code of the tests that inspired them.

## Concepts and terms

The main concepts of Testaro are:

- `job`: a document that tells Testaro what to do.
- `act`: one step in a job.
- `report`: a job that Testaro has added results to.
- `rule engine`: one of the testing applications in the ensemble assembled by Testaro.
- `rule`: a success or failure criterion defined by a rule engine (currently about 1300 across all rule engines).
- `test`: the software that a rule engine uses to apply a rule.
- `target`: a web page that a job tells Testaro to test.
- `result`: the information that Testaro adds to a job to describe the outcomes of the tests of a rule engine.
- `native result`: the outcomes of the tests of a rule engine in exactly or approximately the original form.
- `standard result`: the outcomes of the tests of a rule engine in a uniform Testaro-defined form.
- `catalog`: a collection of data on the HTML elements of a target relevant to one or more tests.

## System requirements

### Operating system and Node.js version

Testaro can be installed under a MacOS, Windows, Debian, or Ubuntu operating system with the latest long-term-support version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Browser security

Testaro is configured so that, when Playwright launches a `chromium` browser, the browser is [sandboxed](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/what-is-browser-sandboxing/) for improved security. That is the default for Playwright, and Testaro does not override that default. The host must therefore permit sandboxed browsers. If you try to run Testaro on a host that prohibits sandboxed browsers, each attempted launch of a `chromium` browser will throw an error with a message complaining about the unavailability of a sandbox.

In some operating systems a sandboxed browser requires an [unprivileged user namespace](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-23-10-restricted-unprivileged-user-namespaces). In one case, a `…userns.conf` file in the `/etc/sysctl.d` directory with the content `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns = 1` prohibits unprivileged user namespaces and thereby makes sandboxed browsers unlaunchable.

#### Option A

One way to cope with this prohibition is to configure Playwright to launch `chromium` non-sandboxed. Launch arguments `'--no-sandbox'` and `'--disable-setuid-sandbox'` are available to specify this. They are added to the arguments of `browserOptionArgs.push` in the Testaro `run.js` file.

This option is **not available for the Playwright `chromium` browser launched by QualWeb**.

Non-sandboxed browsers are less secure than sandboxed ones, particularly when there is no restriction on who can use Testaro and what targets (web pages) they can test with it.

### Option B

Another solution is to leave the `chromium` configuration unchanged, but configure the operating system to permit a sandboxed browser to be launched. In one case, this is implemented with:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0
sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-kilotest-userns.conf >/dev/null <<'EOF'
kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 1
kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns = 0
EOF
sudo sysctl --system
```

This application implements option B.

## Installation as an independent application

To install Testaro as an independent application, rather than a dependency, clone the [Testaro repository](https://github.com/jrpool/testaro). To ensure that the binary browsers of its Playwright dependency get installed, execute `(p)npx playwright install` after executing `(p)npm install`.

To update Testaro when it is an independent application, execute:

```bash
git checkout package-lock.json
git pull
(p)npm run deps
```

## Environment configuration

The `.env` file stores your decisions about the environment in which Testaro runs. The variables that can be defined there are documented in the `env.example` file.

## Jobs

Jobs tell Testaro what to do.

Here is a sample job, showing properties that you can set:

```javaScript
{
  id: 'healthcheck2611', // Job identifier
  what: 'monthly health check', // Job description
  strict: true, // Whether to reject redirections from the target URL
  standard: 'only', // Report native (no), standard (only), or both (also) results
  imageColor: 0, // Color type (0, 2, 4, 6) of the page image, if one is to be created along with a catalog
  device: { // Device to emulate
    id: 'iPhone 8',
    windowOptions: {
      reducedMotion: 'no-preference',
      userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 11_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/604.1.38 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/17.4 Mobile/15A372 Safari/604.1',
      viewport: {
        width: 375,
        height: 667
      },
      deviceScaleFactor: 2,
      isMobile: true,
      hasTouch: true,
      defaultBrowserType: 'webkit'
    }
  },
  browserID: 'chromium', // or 'webkit' or 'firefox'
  stealth: true, // Optional. Whether to enable puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
                 // evasions. Only applies to Chromium (the plugin is
                 // Chromium-specific). Defaults to true. Set false to opt
                 // out — useful for sites whose anti-bot heuristics react
                 // badly to stealth's patches.
  extensions: [ // Optional. Absolute paths of directories of unpacked browser
    '/home/user/exts/highContrastifier' // extensions to be loaded into the
  ],             // browser, e.g. to test how an extension affects the
                 // accessibility of pages. Only Chromium can load extensions,
                 // so, if any are specified, browserID must be 'chromium'.
                 // When extensions are specified, the browser is launched as
                 // a persistent context with a temporary profile, and a
                 // headless launch uses the full Chromium browser in its new
                 // headless mode, because the default headless shell cannot
                 // load extensions.
  creationTimeStamp: '241229T0537', // When job was created
  executionTimeStamp: '250110T1200', // When job will be ready to be performed
  target: {
    what: 'Real Estate Management',
    url: 'https://abccorp.com/mgmt/realproperty'
  },
  sources: { // Any data the requester chooses to add
    script: 'ts99',
    batch: 'departments',
    mergeID: '7f',
    requester: 'malavu@abccorp.com'
  },
  acts: [ // Steps in this job
    {
      type: 'test', // Act type (the 'test' type performs tests of a rule engine)
      launch: {}, // Act-specific overrides for the browserID and/or target
      which: 'axe', // ID of the rule engine
      detailLevel: 2, // An argument required by this rule engine
      rules: ['landmark-complementary-is-top-level'], // Which rules of the rule engine to test for
    },
    {
      type: 'test',
      launch: {
        browserID: 'webkit', // For this act, override browserID to use Webkit
        target: { // For this act, override target to test the contact page
          what: 'Real Estate Management contact',
          url: 'https://abccorp.com/mgmt/realproperty/contactus'
        }
      },
      which: 'qualWeb',
      rules: ['QW-BP25', 'QW-BP26'] // Which rules of the rule engine to test for
    }
  ]
}
```

The `device` property lets you choose among [about 125 devices recognized by Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/packages/playwright-core/src/server/deviceDescriptorsSource.json).

The `browserID` property dictates the first browser type that Testaro uses for its requests. When requests with that browser type are repeatedly rejected, Testaro switches to a different browser type and also replaces the `browserID` property of the job with that new browser type. Targets and their edge-management platforms often block requests from one browser type but not another, so switching browser types can make a job succeed instead of failing or make it finish quickly instead of slowly.

The act types and their options are documented in the `etc` property of the [actSpecs.js](actSpecs.js) object and in the [actSpecs-doc.md](actSpecs-doc.md) file.

## Running jobs

### Job as an object

#### Simple execution

An application can execute a job with:

```javascript
const {doJob} = require('testaro/run');
// Perform the job, which adds content to the job, making it a report.
doJob(job)
.then(report => {
  // Optionally, modify the report.
  …
  return report;
});
```

#### Execution with observability

If the application is capable of listening for events while a job is being executed, it is possible to do that by passing a second argument to `doJob`:

```javascript
const {doJob} = require('testaro/run');
// Perform the job, which adds content to the job, making it a report.
doJob(job, {
  onProgress: event => {
    // Handle the event. For example:
    console.log(event);
  }
})
.then(report => {
  // Optionally, modify the report.
  …
  return report;
});
```

Testaro emits events during job execution that allow an application to monitor progress. The events are:

- `jobStart` - Emitted when a job starts.
- `catalogStart` - Emitted when catalog compilation starts.
- `catalogEnd` - Emitted when catalog compilation ends.
- `actStart` - Emitted when an act starts.
- `actEnd` - Emitted when an act ends.
- `jobEnd` - Emitted when a job ends.

### Job as a file

Jobs can be stored as JSON files in the `todo` subdirectory of a directory identified by the `JOBDIR` environment variable. After Testaro performs such a job, Testaro moves the job file to the `done` subdirectory of the same directory and saves the report in the `raw` subdirectory of the directory identified by the `REPORTDIR` environment variable.

### Immediate performance

A user can make Testaro perform a job from a file with a command like either of:

```bash
node call run
node call run 250725T
```

Testaro will find the first file in the `todo` subdirectory, or, if the second form of the command is used, the first file there whose name begins with the specified string.

### Directory polling

An application can poll the `todo` subdirectory for jobs with:

```javaScript
const {dirWatch} = require('testaro/dirWatch');
dirWatch(true, 300);
```

A user can make Testaro start to poll that subdirectory with:

```javaScript
node call dirWatch true 300
```

In both cases, the first argument of `dirWatch` tells Testaro whether to continue polling after performing one job, and the second argument tells Testaro how many seconds to wait after not finding a job to perform, before polling again.

### Server polling

Testaro can poll a server for jobs to be performed. The server can act as the “controller” described in [How to run a thousand accessibility tests](https://medium.com/cvs-health-tech-blog/how-to-run-a-thousand-accessibility-tests-63692ad120c3). The server is responsible for preparing Testaro jobs, assigning them to Testaro agents, receiving reports back from those agents, and performing any further processing of the reports, including enhancement, storage, and disclosure to audiences. It can be any server reachable with a URL. That includes a server running on the same host as Testaro, with a URL such as `localhost:3000`.

To allow Testaro to poll a server for jobs, define the following environment variables:

- `NETWATCH_URL_JOB`: which URL to poll (the URL must contain the value of the `AGENT` environment variable)
- `NETWATCH_URL_REPORT`: which URL to send job reports to
- `NETWATCH_URL_AUTH`: the password to supply to the server when polling and when delivering a report

The job request sent to the server can be a `POST` request, in which the `agentPW` property of the payload will be the password. Or it can be a `GET` request with the URL containing the password.

Testaro will send the report as a `POST` request whose payload is a JSON object with two properties: `agentPW` (the password) and `report` (the report). However, if the environment does not contain a password, the payload is a JSON object containing only the report.

An application can make Testaro poll a server for jobs with:

```javaScript
const {netWatch} = require('testaro/netWatch');
netWatch(true, 300, true);
```

A user can make Testaro poll a server for jobs with:

```bash
node call netWatch true 300 true
```

The first argument of `netWatch` tells Testaro whether to continue polling after performing the first job. The second argument tells Testaro how many seconds to wait after receiving a no-jobs response before polling again. The third argument tells Testaro whether to be certificate-tolerant, i.e. to accept SSL certificates that fail verification against a list of certificate authorities (the default is `true`).

## Reports

A report is a job with information about the results of the performance of the job inserted by Testaro into the job.

### Whole-job data

As Testaro performs a job, information about the job as a whole is inserted into the job. That information is organized into one, two, or three properties:

- `jobData`: Facts about the performance of the job
- `catalog`: A collection of data about the HTML elements of the target that are relevant to any test failures
- `images`: A collection of page images captured during the job

#### `jobData`

Testaro inserts the `jobData` property into every job.

#### `catalog`

Testaro inserts the `catalog` property only into jobs that instruct Testaro to produce standard results. The catalog is an inventory of HTML elements in the DOM of the target.

The `catalog` property has an object value. Here is an example:

```javascript
'123': {
  tagName: 'SUMMARY',
  id: 'functionsummary',
  startTag: '<summary>',
  text: 'Functional\nAlways active',
  textLinkable: true,
  boxID: '46:230:860:263',
  pathID: '/html/body/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/details[1]/summary[1]'
},
```

If the inner text of the element consists of only one line, that is the value of `text`. If the inner text consists of two or more lines, `text` is the first and last of these, delimited with a newline.

The `textLinkable` property has a true value whenever `text` is non-empty and can generate a text-fragment URL that uniquely identifies an element.

The segments of `boxID` are `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`.

The catalog is a mechanism for the integration of the rule engines. Most rule violations that rule engines report are blamed on particular HTML elements. A rule engine typically reports that an element violated a rule by having some defect in its configuration or behavior. But rule engines describe elements differently. Testaro makes the rule engines identify the XPaths of the elements they report as violators. Testaro then finds, for each XPath, the correct catalog entry.

Testaro uses the following techniques to make the rule engines calculate XPaths:

- `alfa` and `aslint`: They report XPaths, so Testaro needs only to normalize them.
- `ed11y`: Testaro adds it and a `window.getXPath` method to the page. When the rule engine reports an element, Testaro computes its XPath.
- `wave`: It reports a selector for each element; Testaro finds each element in the page via its selector and executes `window.getXPath` on the element.
- `htmlcs`, `ibm`, `nuVal`, `nuVnu`, `qualWeb`: Testaro adds `data-xpath` attributes to all elements. The rule engines include code excerpts, with the `data-xpath` attributes, in the reported violations.
- `axe`: It reports a selector for each element, and Testaro adds `data-xpath` attributes to all elements. Testaro finds each element in the page via its selector and uses the `data-xpath` attribute. When this fails, Testaro uses the `data-xpath` attribute if its complete value is included in the reported `node.html` value.
- `testaro`: Testaro designs each of its own tests to report element XPaths.

By attaching a catalog entry to each reported element, Testaro allows an application that uses Testaro to tell users, for any particular HTML element, which rule engines ascribed violations of which rules to that element. An application could, for example, use a screenshot or a text-fragment link or could ask the user to paste the XPath into a browser developer tool.

In some cases no catalog entry can be found. The reasons may include:

- The element was dynamically created after the catalog was created.
- The element is inside a `noscript` element and therefore not considered an element in the DOM.
- The violation is not ascribed to a single element.

#### `images`

Testaro inserts an `images` array property if necessary to store page images in the report. If the job has an `imageColor` property with `0`, `2`, `4`, or `6` as its value and Testaro will insert a `catalog` property, then Testaro also creates a page image with that color type and makes its base64-encoded PNG the first item in the `images` array.

There is a `shoot` act type that can be used to make additional page images during a job.

### Act data

As Testaro performs the acts of a job, information about the result of each act is inserted into that act. For acts of type `test`, the added properties are:

- `startTime`: When Testaro began to perform the act
- `actualURL`: The tested URL (different from the target URL if the request was redirected)
- `data`: Data generated by the rule engine
- `result`: Result of the testing by the rule engine

The `result` property is an object with one or two (depending on the value of `standard`, as described above) subproperties:

- `nativeResult`: The result (or a compact version of the result) natively produced by the rule engine
- `standardResult`: A Testaro-standardized version of the result

If an act of type `test` contains an `expect` property (specifying expectations about the result), then Testaro also inserts these properties into the act:

- `expectations`: Data on what was expected versus the actual result
- `expectationFailures`: The count of failed expectations

Details about these expectation properties are documened in the `VALIDATION.md` file.

#### Standard results

If the job instructs Testaro to include standard results, then the `result.standardResult` property of each act of type `test` will have three properties:

- `prevented`: Whether the rule engine was prevented from performing the act
- `totals`: An array of 4 integers, counting the rule violations at 4 severity levels
- `instances`: An array of data about the violations reported by the rule engine

More specifically:

- The `totals` value is an array like this: `[3, 0, 87, 4]`. This example would mean that the rule engine reported 3 failures at severity 0 (the least severe level), none at severity 1, 87 at severity 2, and 4 at severity 3. These four severities are conceptually ordinal, not metric.
- The `instances` value is an array of objects, each having these properties:
  - `ruleId`: The ID of the rule that was violated
  - `what`: A description of the rule or of the violation
  - `ordinalSeverity`: The severity of the violation
  - `count`: How many violations of the rule this instance reports
  - `catalogIndex`: Key of the HTML element in the catalog

If no catalog entry was found for the instance, then instead of a `catalogIndex` property Testaro tries to insert a `pathID` property, whose value is a normalized XPath of the offending HTML element.

## Rule-engine details

The rule engines whose tests Testaro performs have particularities described below.

### ASLint

The `aslint` rule engine makes use of the [`aslint-testaro` fork](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aslint-testaro) of the [`aslint` repository](https://github.com/essentialaccessibility/aslint), which, unlike the published `aslint` package, contains the `aslint.bundle.js` file.

### HTML CodeSniffer

The `htmlcs` rule engine makes use of the `htmlcs/HTMLCS.js` file. That file was created, and can be recreated if necessary, as follows:

1. Clone the [HTML CodeSniffer package](https://github.com/squizlabs/HTML_CodeSniffer).
1. Make that package’s directory the active directory.
1. Install the HTML CodeSniffer dependencies by executing `npm install`.
1. Build the HTML CodeSniffer auditor by executing `grunt build`.
1. Copy the `build/HTMLCS.js` and `build/licence.txt` files into the `htmlcs` directory of Testaro.
1. Edit the Testaro copy of `htmlcs/HTMLCS.js` to produce the changes shown below.

The changes in `htmlcs/HTMLCS.js` are:

```diff
479a480
>     '4_1_2_attribute': 'attribute',
6482a6484
>     var messageStrings = new Set();
6496d6497

6499d6499

6500a6501
>       return Array.from(messageStrings);
6531c6532,6534
<       console.log('[HTMLCS] ' + typeName + '|' + msg.code + '|' + nodeName + '|' + elementId + '|' + msg.msg + '|' + html);
---
>       messageStrings.add(
>         typeName + '|' + msg.code + '|' + nodeName + '|' + elementId + '|' + msg.msg + '|' + html
>       );
```

### Accessibility Checker

The `ibm` tests require the `aceconfig.js` file.

As of 2 March 2023 (version 3.1.45 of `accessibility-checker`), the `ibm` rule engine threw errors when hosted under the Windows operating system. To prevent these errors, it was possible to edit two files in the `accessibility-checker` package as follows:

In `node_modules/accessibility-checker/lib/ACEngineManager.js`, remove or comment out these lines starting on line 169:

```javaScript
if (nodePath.charAt(0) !== '/') {
    nodePath = "../../" + nodePath;
}
```

In `node_modules/accessibility-checker/lib/reporters/ACReporterJSON.js`, add these lines starting on line 106, immediately before the line `var resultsFileName = pathLib.join(resultDir, results.label + '.json');`:

```javaScript
// Replace the colons in the label with hyphen-minuses.
results.label = results.label.replace(/:/g, '-');
```

These changes were proposed as [pull requests 1333 and 1334](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/pulls).

The `ibm` rule engine is one of two rule engines (`testaro` is the other) with a `withItems` property. If you set `withItems` to `false`, the result includes the counts of “violations” and “recommendations”, but no information about the rules that gave rise to them.

### Nu Html Checker

The `nuVal` and `nuVnu` rule engines perform the tests of the Nu Html Checker. The `nuVal` rule engine is a remote service with an API. The `nuVnu` rule engine is installed as a dependency. A job can choose either one, or can try `nuVal` and if it fails then invoke `nuVnu`.

Its `rules` argument is **not** an array of rule IDs, but instead is an array of rule _specifications_. A rule specification for `nuVal` or `nuVnu` is a string with the format `=ruleID` or `~ruleID`. The `=` prefix indicates that the rule ID is invariable. The `~` prefix indicates that the rule ID is variable, in which case the `ruleID` part of the specification is a matching regular expression, rather than the exact text of a message. This `rules` format arises from the fact that `nuVal` and `nuVnu` generate customized messages and do not accompany them with rule identifiers.

### QualWeb

The `qualWeb` rule engine performs the ACT rules, WCAG Techniques, and best-practices tests of QualWeb. Only failures and warnings are included in the report. The EARL report of QualWeb is not generated, because it is equivalent to the report of the ACT rules tests.

QualWeb allows specification of rules for 3 modules: `act-rules`, `wcag-techniques`, and `best-practices`. If you include a `rules` argument in a QualWeb test act, its value must be an array of 1, 2, or 3 strings. Any string in that array is a specification for one of these modules. The string has this format:

```javascript
'mod:m,n,o,p,…'
```

In that format:

- Replace `mod` with `act`, `wcag`, or `best`.
- Replace `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`, etc. with the 0 or more integers that identify rules.

For example, `'best:6,11'` would specify that QualWeb is to test for `best-practices` rules `QW-BP6` and `QW-BP11`, but not for any other `best-practices` rules.

When a string contains only a module prefix and no integers, such as `best:`, it specifies that the module is not to be run at all.

When no string pertains to a module, then QualWeb will test for all of the rules in that module.

Thus, when the `rules` argument is omitted, QualWeb will test for all of the rules in all of these modules.

The target can be provided to QualWeb either as HTML or as a URL. Experience indicates that the results can differ between these methods, with each method reporting some rule violations or some instances that the other method does not report. For at least some cases, more rules are reported violated when HTML is provided (`withNewItems: false`).

QualWeb creates sandboxed Puppeteer pages to perform its tests on. Therefore, the host must permit sandboxed browsers to be launched. See the discussion above about browser security.

### Testaro

The rules that Testaro can test for are implemented in files within the `testaro` directory.

The Testaro rules are classified by an `allRules` array defined in the `tests/testaro.js` file. Each item in that array is an object with these properties:

- `id`: the rule ID.
- `what`: a description of the rule.
- `contaminates`: whether the test for the rule modifies the page, requiring the next test to launch a new browser for test isolation
- `needsAccessibleName`: whether the rule requires an added script adding an accessible-name computation method to `window`
- `timeOut`: the maximum time in seconds allowed for a test of the rule
- `defaultOn`: whether the rule is to be tested for by default

If you do not specify rules when using the `testaro` rule engine, Testaro will test for its default rules, in the order in which they appear in the array.

The optional `rules` argument for a `testaro` test act is an array whose first item is either `'y'` or `'n'` and whose remaining items are rule IDs. If `'y'`, then only the specified rules’ tests are performed. If `'n'`, then all the default rules are tested for, **except** for the specified rules.

The `testaro` rule engine (like the `ibm` rule engine) has a `withItems` property. If you set it to `false`, the `standardResult` object will contain an `instances` property with summaries that identify issues and instance counts. If you set it to `true`, some of the instances will be itemized.

Unlike any other rule engine, the `testaro` rule engine requires a `stopOnFail` property, which specifies whether a failure to conform to any rule (i.e. any value of `totals` other than `[0, 0, 0, 0]`) should terminate the execution of tests for the remaining rules.

Tests of the `testaro` tests (i.e. _validation_) could previously be performed as documented in the `VALIDATION.md` file. This functionality has broken and its redesign is planned.

One Testaro rule, `allCaps`, is currently being tested for in part with the assistance of the Claude Haiku artificial intelligence (AI) model. To obtain that assistance, you need an Anthropic API key, and its value must be assigned to the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in the `.env` file. If no valid API key is set there, the rule will be tested for, but without AI assistance.

### WAVE

If a `wave` test act is included in the job, the WAVE tests will be performed either by the subscription API or by the stand-alone API.

If you want the subscription API to perform the tests, you must get a WAVE API key from [WebAIM](https://wave.webaim.org/api/) and assign it as the value of an environment variable named `WAVE_KEY`. The subscription API does not accept a transmitted document for testing. WAVE must be given only a URL, which it then visits to perform its tests. Therefore, you cannot manipulate a page and then have WAVE test it, or ask WAVE to test a page that cannot be reached directly with a URL.

If you want the stand-alone API to perform the tests, you need to have that API installed and running, and the `wave` test act needs to define the URL of your stand-alone API. The test act can also define a `prescript` script and/or a `postscript` script.

## Accessibility principles

The rationales motivating the Testaro-defined tests can be found in comments within the files of those tests, in the `testaro` directory. Unavoidably, each test is opinionated. Testaro itself, however, can accommodate other tests representing different opinions. Testaro is intended to be neutral with respect to questions such as the criteria for accessibility, the severities of accessibility defects, whether accessibility is binary or graded, and the distinction between usability and accessibility.

## Challenges

### Abnormal termination

On some occasions a test throws an error that cannot be handled with a `try`-`catch` structure. It has been observed, for example, that the `ibm` test does this when the page content, rather than the page URL, is given to `getCompliance()` and the target is `https://globalsolutions.org`, `https://monsido.com`, or `https://www.ambetterhealth.com/`.

Some rule engines take apparently infinite time to perform their tests on some pages. One website whose pages prevent 5 of the rule engines from ever completing their tests is the site of BrowserStack.

To handle such fatal errors and stalls, Testaro runs the tests of each rule engine in a separate forked child process that executes the `procs/doTestAct.js` module. The parent process subjects each rule engine to a time limit and kills the child if the time limit expires.

### Activation

Testing to determine what happens when a control or link is activated is straightforward, except in the context of a comprehensive set of tests of a single page. There, activating a control or link can change the page or navigate away from it, interfering with the remaining planned tests of the page.

The Playwright “Receives Events” actionability check does **not** check whether an event is dispatched on an element. It checks only whether a click on the location of the element makes the element the target of that click, rather than some other element occupying the same location.

### Test prevention

Test targets employ mechanisms to prevent scraping, multiple requests within a short time, automated form submission, and other automated actions. These mechanisms may interfere with testing. When a test act is prevented, Testaro reports this prevention.

Some targets prohibit the execution of alien scripts unless the client can demonstrate that it is the requester of the page. Failure to provide that evidence results in the script being blocked and an error message being logged, saying “Refused to execute a script because its hash, its nonce, or unsafe-inline does not appear in the script-src directive of the Content Security Policy”. This mechanism affects rule engines that insert scripts into a target in order to test it. To comply with this requirement, Testaro obtains a _nonce_ from the response that serves the target. Then the file that runs the rule engine adds that nonce to the script as the value of a `nonce` attribute when it inserts its script into the target.

Some targets have been found erratically to prevent the creation of page images. When page images have been created, during the `motion` test in `testaro` some targets have been found to prevent their comparison by BlazeDiff, but comparison by `pixelmatch` has succeeded. For this reason, although reportedly slower, `pixelmatch` is the library used for image comparison.

### Rule-engine duplicativity

Rule engines sometimes do redundant testing, in that two or more rule engines test for the same defects, although such duplications are not necessarily perfect. This fact creates problems:

- One cannot be confident in excluding some tests of some rule engines on the assumption that they perfectly duplicate tests of other rule engines.
- The Testaro report from a job documents each rule engine’s results separately, so a single defect may be documented in multiple locations within the report, making the direct consumption of the report inefficient.
- An effort to aggregate the results into a single score may distort the scores by inflating the weights of defects that happen to be discovered by multiple rule engines.
- Rule engines use different methods for identifying the locations of elements that violate rule-engine rules.

### Rule-engine malfunctions

Rule engines can become faulty. For example, Alfa stopped reporting any rule violations in mid-April 2024 and resumed doing so at the end of April. In some cases, such as this, the rule-engine maker corrects the fault. In others, the rule engine changes and forces Testaro to change its handling of the rule engine.

### Dependency deployment

The behavior of Testaro as a dependency of an application deployed on a virtual private server has been observed to be vulnerable to slower performance and more frequent test preventions than when Testaro is deployed as a stand-alone application on a workstation. The configuration of Testaro has been tuned for mitigation of such behaviors.

### Containerized deployment

A reference container image for stand-alone deployment, in which all rule engines run, is defined by the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files at the project root and documented in [CONTAINERS.md](CONTAINERS.md).

### Headless browser fidelity

Testaro normally performs tests with headless browsers. Some experiments appear to have shown that some test results are inaccurate with headless browsers, but this has not been replicated. The `launch` function in the `run` module accepts a `headEmulation` argument with `'high'` and `'low'` values. Its purpose is to permit optimizations of headless browsers to be turned off, so browsers behave and appear more similar to headed browsers. Observation has failed to show any performance cost, so `'high'` is the default value.

## Repository exclusions

Any files in the `temp` or `tmp` directory are presumed ephemeral and are not tracked by `git`. Jobs create temporary files in subdirectories of `tmp` and delete those subdirectories on termination.

### Testilo

[Testilo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testilo) is an application that:

- converts lists of targets and lists of issues into jobs
- produces scores and adds them to the raw reports of Testaro
- produces human-oriented HTML digests from scored reports
- produces human-oriented HTML comparisons of the scores of targets

Testilo contains procedures that reorganize report data by issue and by element, rather than rule engine, and that compensate for duplicative tests when computing scores.

Report standardization could be performed by other software rather than by Testaro. That would require sending the original reports to the server. They are typically larger than standardized reports. Whenever users want only standardized reports, the fact that Testaro standardizes them eliminates the need to send the original reports anywhere.

### Kilotest

[Kilotest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kilotest) is an application that offers a simplified interface to Testaro. At present it is [deployed as a public service](https://kilotest.com/).

## Code style

The JavaScript code in this project generally conforms to the ESLint configuration file `.eslintrc.json`. However, the `htmlcs/HTMLCS.js` file implements an older version of JavaScript. Its style is regulated by the `htmlcs/.eslintrc.json` file.

## History

Work on the `testaro` tests in this package began in 2017, and work on the multi-package ensemble that Testaro implements began in early 2018. These two aspects were combined into an “Autotest” package in early 2021 and into the more single-purpose packages, Testaro and Testilo, in January 2022.

On 12 February 2024 ownership of the Testaro repository was transfered from the personal account of contributor Jonathan Pool to the organization account `cvs-health` of CVS Health. The MIT license of the [repository](https://github.com/cvs-health/testaro) did not change, but the copyright holder changed to CVS Health.

Maintenance of the repository owned by CVS Health came to an end on 30 September 2025. The current repository was forked from the `cvs-health` repository in October 2025 and then unlinked from the fork network, by agreement with CVS Health.
